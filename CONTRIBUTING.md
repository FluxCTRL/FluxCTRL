## Issues

Please read the following before reporting an issue. But first, make sure
you have:

* the latest version of a stable branch
* a very recent version of the browser you are using (IE not supported)
* checked if someone else has already reported the same issue

When reporting, please include:

* a detailed description of the problem
* step-by-step instructions to reproduce it (or a test case)
* what you have tried

## Pull Requests

Contributions are welcomed!

That been said, there are some rules:

* fork only from the `master` branch
* follow established conventions; when in doubt, run the `CakePHP` code sniff
* optionally, include tests; makes things faster

## Features

As much as I like contributions, the goal is to keep the codebase as lean as
possible. Any feature can be implemented as a plugin (and when not, it's an
[issue](#issues)). Look at some of the core features to see how it works.
