# Clear Theme for FluxCTRL

Minimalistic, crisp and clean theme for [FluxCTRL][fluxctrl].

## About

Because FluxCTRL is only meant to be an API, even it's default theme, this
one, is developed separately to avoid any coupling and help spot weaknesses
in the underlying architecture.

## Usage

For now, this comes pre-installed with FluxCTRL. No extra steps required.
